## 1. Overview

The **Forza Tracker** is a companion application used to track race and telemetry data during specific events in **Forza Motorsport**. It is designed to enhance the competitive experience by extracting real-time data, lap times, and driver performances.

The primary use case for the Tracker is during gaming events/expos, such as Spillexpo, Dreamhack and Gamebox Festival. This tracker integrates with the game and delivers accurate tracking data, allowing our partners to organize tournaments and challenges during an event.

This guide will walk you through the initial setup, usage, and best practices for integrating our Tracker with Forza. It covers everything from installation to troubleshooting, ensuring that new partners can get started quickly and experienced users can take full advantage of its features.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Common Pitfalls:

- **Tracker Not Opening**: If the tracker does not open from the taskbar, ensure it was installed properly and try launching it again.
- **Incorrect Timing in First Race**: Always remember that the first race will not be timed correctly. After the initial round, the system will function as expected.
- **Full-Screen Tracker Locking You Out**: Since the tracker runs full-screen, it can lock you out of the desktop. To exit, use **Alt+Tab** or the **Windows button** to access the taskbar.

### Best Practices:

- **Taskbar Access**: Pin the tracker to the taskbar for easy access, especially during full-screen gaming sessions.
- **Pre-Game Setup**: Always configure your race and car settings **before** opening the tracker.
- **Testing**: Run a few test races with staff or volunteers before starting official events to ensure the setup works seamlessly.

## 6. FAQ

### Q1: Why is my first race time incorrect?

The first race is used to calibrate the tracker. Times for the first round are inaccurate, but all subsequent races will be tracked correctly.

### Q2: Can I use the tracker with any car?

Technically, yes. But remember to adjust it according to your race settings. **McLaren 1976 #11 M23**.

### Q3: What should I do if the tracker locks my screen?

Since the tracker runs full-screen, use the **Alt+Tab** or **Windows button** to regain access to your desktop or taskbar.

### Q4: Can I configure my own race settings?

While it's possible to adjust settings in Forza, the tracker is optimized for the configurations provided in this guide. Deviating from the recommended setup may result in inaccurate tracking data.

### Q5: What do I do if the QR code doesn’t scan?

Ensure that your QR scanner is working properly and that the tracker is running. It is important that the device has a working internet connection (F.e. WiFi or 3G/4G/5G).

If the problem persists, try restarting the tracker or using another device to scan the code.

### Q6: How can I test with many different users on my phone?

On iPhone and Safari, you can change to Private browsing before scanning the QR code. Then your phone will not remember your sign up.
